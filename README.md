# weather-app

**General Info**

In this project, I was able to use an external API to display the weather for different places around the world. I was able to practice using asynchronous code as well as syntactical sugar like async/await. I also added a dark mode option that changes the backgroung image from day time to night time and also changes the text color to ensure visibility. I was able to sharpen my skills with CSS animations by using keyframes to create a slide up effect to display the results of the user's search. 

**Concepts Covered**

Asynchronous Functions | External APIs | Fetch API | Advanced CSS Animations
